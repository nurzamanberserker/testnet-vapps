## Developer

* **Name**: Khoirul Abror
* **GitHub**: @nurzamanberserker
* **Discord**: khoirul_abror
* **Experience**: 3 years building decentralized applications with Solidity and Node.js. Contributor to several Web3 hackathons, experienced in smart contract development, API integrations, and full-stack dApp architecture.

## Project

### Name & Category

* **Project**: \[Deplay]
* **Category**: \[identity/defi/social/gaming/infrastructure/other]

### Description

\[Describe the problem your vApp solves, why it matters, and what it does. Example: “This vApp enables users to seamlessly verify their decentralized identity across multiple chains, providing trustless reputation scores integrated with SL.”]

### SL Integration

Explain how your project will use the **Soundness Layer (SL)**. Example:

* Utilizing SL’s verification to ensure secure user authentication
* Leveraging SL’s interoperability for cross-chain interactions
* Using SL features to enhance privacy and trust in transactions

## Technical

### Architecture

High-level system design: how frontend, backend, smart contracts, and SL interact.

### Stack

* **Frontend**: React + TailwindCSS
* **Backend**: Node.js/Express
* **Blockchain**: Soundness Layer (SL) + Ethereum testnet
* **Storage**: IPFS + WALRUS (for decentralized file storage)

### Features

1. Decentralized user authentication with SL
2. Cross-chain token interaction or verification
3. Dashboard with user-friendly UI to track and manage activities

## Timeline

### PoC (2-4 weeks)

* [ ] Implement basic smart contracts
* [ ] Integrate SL for simple verification
* [ ] Basic frontend with minimal UI

### MVP (4-8 weeks)

* [ ] Full feature set integrated
* [ ] Production-ready deployment
* [ ] User testing and feedback collection

## Innovation

\[Explain what makes this project unique. Example: “Unlike existing identity apps, this vApp leverages SL’s verification to provide portable, cross-chain reputation scores that are interoperable with DeFi, gaming, and social dApps.”]

## Contact

Preferred contact: Discord (khoirul_abror) or GitHub (@nurzamanberserker). Updates will be shared through GitHub repository and Discord channels.
